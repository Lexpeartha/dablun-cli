Extended version of the app covered by [Traversy Media's tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6OAHsde15E)


### Installation process

Clone this repo on your machine(which, I assume has `npm` and `node` installed on it), and run:

```shell
npm install
```

to install all dependencies, and:

```shell
npm link
```

to make CLI available globally on machine. After this, you should be able to run this command
```shell
dablun-cli -h
```


### Contribution guide

Take a look at proper markdown for that in this repo!

This is still work in project, and any help/suggestion is welcome!
